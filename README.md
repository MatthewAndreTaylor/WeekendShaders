# Weekend Shaders

These are little shader artworks I do on the weekend.

## 🗓️ Shader Logs

**Saturday, July 6 - SVG to Shader Compiler**

I wrote a program which compiles a svg to a shader. Currently the program is very simple and does not do any optimization.

**Saturday, June 27 – Katana**

I drew a katana with simple shapes and gave the blade a gradient. It would be cool to animate in the future.

**Sunday, June 15 – Neural Network Visualization**

More procedural character movement added a wiggle and jumping movement.

I wanted to write a program to visualize a fully connected neural network.
I used a different color gradient for each network connection in combination with each layer.

**Sunday, June 15 – Voxel Raymarching Chicken**

I used voxels to design a chicken and rendered it using raymarching.

**Sunday, June 1 – Procedural Snake Animation**

I animated a snake procedurally. The snake body segments follow a smooth trajectory.

**Saturday, May 24 – Grass Movement**

I simulated a bunch of little grass pieces being moved by the wind. I liked the color palette I used.

**Friday, May 23 – Ray Marching Letters**

I drew the first letter of my name "M" using Ray Marching and a custom signed distance function (SDF).
In future work I could try to render more complex [tetrahedra](https://developer.nvidia.com/gpugems/gpugems3/part-v-physics-simulation/chapter-34-signed-distance-fields-using-single-pass-gpu)

**Sunday, May 18 – Procedural Trees**

I wanted to see if I could draw procedurally generated 2d trees as a shader. I had seen some examples, but was wondering if I could do something similar to the recursive approach inside a shader.

**Sunday, May 11 – Starfield**

I turned my old highschool project below into a shader.

# Weekend shaders

These are little shader artworks I do on the weekend.

Sunday May 11, Starfield:
I turned my old project below into a shader.

Sunday May 18, Procedural trees:
I wanted to see if I could draw procedurally generated 2d trees as a shader. I had seen some examples, but was wondering if I could do something similar to the recursive approach inside a shader.

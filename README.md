**Sunday, May 11 – Starfield**

I turned my old project below into a shader.

**Sunday, May 18 – Procedural Trees**

I wanted to see if I could draw procedurally generated 2d trees as a shader. I had seen some examples, but was wondering if I could do something similar to the recursive approach inside a shader.
